# Psitron Kubeflow pipelines 

# Charmed Kuebflow Kubernetes setup

This repo is contains collection of steps for setting up Charmed Kubeflow on single Amazon EC2 instance.

## Prerequisites

You need to have AWS account. Here you can find steps on how to create one.

IMPORTANT NOTE: to run the kubeflow in EC2 instance (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS) we need to use at least t2.2xlarge instance type with at least 50GBs of storage (in demo I use gp2). Prepare to pay for this instance (around 10 dollars, the value is just estimate reality may be higher).

Deployment may take up to 30 minutes.
